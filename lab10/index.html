				<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>At first the CSS wasn't being applied at all to the HTML. But then one time when I
				checked in the browser it worked. I'm not sure what changed or if it just
				needed time to update to the webpage.

				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>I tried to import some font families into the CSS and they don't
					 seem to be working. The word spacing in CSS also didn't apply to the
					 webpage.<br>
					 I wasn't able to have the title or the screenshots section change color with CSS.</p>

				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>The results are as you see above.</p>
