<p> In this lab I added an image to the home page and sized it.
	I added lnks to the different labs and made them a list.
	I spent about an hour troubleshooting the image. Because I had written <img src=img/"old-headshot-taken-in-petaluma.jpg">,
	instead of <img src="img/old-headshot-taken-in-petaluma.jpg">.
	So, I learned that every little detail matters.</p>
