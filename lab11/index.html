			<p>I have always been creative, but I have wondered if it will be finanically
				relaable. During childhood I was around a father who had a career in database
				work. He was a photographer on the side. I'm not close with him now but I
				share his interests. I have been interested in photography since I was young.
				My mother was able to afford a entry level DSLR for me when I was a young teen.
				I have been taught through proffessors and people on YouTube.
				<br>
				I have taken friends senior portraits, couples photos, and headshots. I also
				go out into nature early in the morning or around sunset and blue hour
				to take landscape and the occasional wildlife photo.
				<br>
				I started a Communications Design major bacause I wanted to have photography
				or cameras in my future careers but I didn't want to rely only on photography.
				I have settled on something in graphic or web design.
