	<h1>Lab 1: Exploring the Modern Web</h1>
	<p> For our first lab we looked at different websites and choose a few that we
		liked, and described what we like about it. Some of the websites I found were...</p>
	<li><a href="https://www.juliajohnson.com" target="_new"> www.juliajohnson.com</a></li>
	<p>I like how as you scroll down the name and background seem to stay the same, but the photos move.
		They also enter the window as a block of color and gradually reveal the image,
		then go back to a block of color when they get near the top.
		This allows the viewer to focus on one image at a time.</p>
	<li><a href="https://grege-interieurs.com" target="_new"> www.//grege-interieurs.com</a></li>
	<p>I like how the menu system looks like postcards and when you click the
		arrow to go through them it shuffles as if it were a group for cards.</p>
	<li><a href="https://shpro.info/" target="_new"> www.//shpro.info/</a></li>
	<p>I like all the hand drawn style of the icons, and that one is their
		signature being signed out. I also like how the headers are covered up by
		the photo albums as the user scrolls down the page.</p>

	<h2>Sef Evaluation</h2>
	<p>I enjoyed looking through the different websites but focused on
		photography portfolios because that in the only website Iâ€™ve tried to put
		together and am most interested in at the moment. Some of the portfolios
		websites were designed to look more chaotic which is fun to look at.
		But for a portfolio I would want something more organized so people knew
		where there were on the page and what section. Rather then just having a
		wall of photos, similar to instagram.</p>
