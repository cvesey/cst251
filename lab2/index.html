	<h2>Summary & Self Evaluation</h2>
	<p>While working with Hyeonseo we created this page, I got a bit confused by
		the head and body tags. I though that they were commands for the computer,
		but they are just added as labels for the coder to keep the code more
		ogranize.</p>
		<p>We weren't sure what to write for the paragraph so we kept it really
			simple, and said "We both like cats."</p>
