            <p>There was a bit of a late start to the meeting.
              But once everyone was there it was a bit hard to come up with critisizm.
              We talked about a lot of things that could be slightly changed or idea to add to enhance the page.</p>

        <h2>Results</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>We all had similar ideas for the treasure map homepage. The only difference was realism
              vs. a pirate treasure map. We are planning to use aspects from both designs.
              For the other pages we came up with different veriations and agreed
              on wich we liked the best out of all of our designs</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>For the different locations we all had quite different ideas. We all agreed on some
              that we liked the best out of everyones. The different locations all have something
              special about their page (e.g., fog on the images, wave transitions).</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>The results are as you see above.</p>
